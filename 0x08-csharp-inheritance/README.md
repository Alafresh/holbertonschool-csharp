  > 0-is/ "returns True if the object is an int, otherwise return False"
  >
  > 1-instance/ "returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, Array, otherwise return False"
  >
  > 2-subclass/ " The object must be a subclass; your method cannot return True if the object is an instance of the base class."
